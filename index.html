    <P style="text-align: justify;">A boutique  is a retail shop that deals in high end fashionable clothing or accessories. The word is French for "shop", which derives ultimately from the Ancient Greek "storehouse".

        The term boutique and also designer refer to both goods and services, which are containing some element that is claimed to justify an extremely high price.Clothing boutiques not only compete with other local boutiques, but they also compete with clothing retailers, department stores and big box merchandisers. A clothing boutique is an exciting venture that can be started after some research.The term "boutique" entered common English parlance in the late 1960s. In Europe, Avenue Montaigne and Bond Street were the focus of much media attention for having the most fashionable stores of the era. Some multi-outlet businesses (Chain stores) can be referred to as boutiques if they target small, upscale niche markets. Although some boutiques specialize in hand-made items and other unique products, others simply produce T-shirts, stickers, and other fashion accessories in artificially small runs and sell them at high prices.</P>
