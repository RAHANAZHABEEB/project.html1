<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<P>A boutique  is a retail shop that deals in high end fashionable clothing or accessories. The word is French for "shop", which derives ultimately from the Ancient Greek "storehouse". The term boutique and also designer refer to both goods and services, which are containing some element that is claimed to justify an extremely high price.Clothing boutiques not only compete with other local boutiques, but they also compete with clothing retailers, department stores and big box merchandisers. A clothing boutique is an exciting venture that can be started after some research.The term "boutique" entered common English parlance in the late 1960s. In Europe, Avenue Montaigne and Bond Street were the focus of much media attention for having the most fashionable stores of the era. Some multi-outlet businesses (Chain stores) can be referred to as boutiques if they target small, upscale niche markets. Although some boutiques specialize in hand-made items and other unique products, others simply produce T-shirts, stickers, and other fashion accessories in artificially small runs and sell them at high prices.There are three types of market orientation these include customer orientation, competitor orientation, and inter-influential coordination. Lost and Found second-hand clothing store focuses its marketing strategy in meeting the consumer’s through the products the store offers. Therefore, the store’s market orientation is customer orientation. The store wants its customers to become persistent, for this reason, the clothing store has developed a flexible strategy. This is because such a strategy can respond to changes in consumer’s perceptions and demand that the retail industry is constantly subjected to. There are several benefits of a flexible marketing plan. Flexibility in a marketing enables the company to take action when problems and opportunities occur though it can cause chaos if there no brand management.In order for a business to be able to understand fully its target market and deal with it more successfully than its competitors, it is important to divide the segments characterized by their needs. Lost and Found market has three types of segments geographic, demographic and psychographic.   Firstly, market segmentations show that 65.5% of customers in the used goods store industry are between the ages of 35to 64 years and will constantly continue to compose the largest percentage of the second-hand industry for the next five years. The Lost and Found main target market is parents with no children or those with small families for this reason; this group of people is part of the major market segments. Furthermore, the boutique also targets teenagers as used clothing, specifically is becoming a trend the shop is placed on.For the geographical segments, Montreal is experiences four different seasons warm, hot and humid summers, mild spring and autumn and very cold and snowy winters. This means that most of weather in Montreal is cold or humid for this reason, the boutique should stock more on coats, leggings, boots, scarves and hats for the cold weather and less on the short, dresses and lighter materials for the summer months. On the psychographic segments people residing in Montreal are attracted to versatile, reasonably priced, durable clothes, not too fancy and comfortable materials. They love to shop at smaller stores for better quality, great discounts on prices, unique pieces, recycle aspect, the ambience of the store and thriftiness. Thriftiness refers to getting good pieces in mint condition for significantly less than their original retail price.Fashion has more than often stemmed from a city’s special charm and appeal and the city of Vancouver has a distinctive charm. As a result, the fashion industry in Vancouver has been booming in the last few years. Vancouver’s fashion week is one of the biggest fashion events in North America, while Vancouver itself is recognized as one of Canada's most ethnically diverse cities, thus, it is no wonder that this multicultural influence has greatly helped the city to become one of the global leaders in fashion. With ideas coming in from virtually all the places of the globe, converting and building on the visions of others can be an exciting route. Stylishness in Vancouver comes from the past and extends all the way to the fascinating present and future, and more than a few names of the heavy cards of fashion industry are currently based in Vancouver. For example, in the last few years, Lululemon Athletica has grown from a distinct Kitsilano workout-wear boutique, in a store initially comprised from a design atelier, a retail boutique, and a shared space with a yoga studio to a globally well-known brand. Founded by Dennis "Chip" Wilson in 1998, “lulu” was aiming to cover the growing female participation in sports and with the view in yoga as the greatest way to sustain athletic spirit and fitness at all ages. Another astonishing fashion brand coming from Vancouver, Native Shoes was established in Vancouver in 2009 with the idea of combining the finest of surfacing technology with great design and while their construction is enthused by classic, casual outlines, the shoes are made from a lightweight, tough and water resistant material that is ideal for rainy cities. At that moment, Native has obtained international distribution in more than 40 countries.A company that combines design with innovation, The Modern Mirror, represents the description of fashion tech. This fashion firm is evolving a system that allows luxury fashion brands such as Louis Vuitton to scan clients’ bodies and show a 3D image of them trying the clothes sold at the physical store. According to The Modern Mirror’s CEO, Nicole Reader, shops have greater chances of making a sale once the potential client comes into the fitting room but this is but there lies the dare – a handful of customers do not want to enter the fitting room and there she sees the potential market for the novel idea behind her business .</P>
